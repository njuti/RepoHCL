structure_trimmer = '''
You are a professional code base organization assistant. 
Your task is to help users clean up the directory structure of the C/C++ project repository and remove paths that are not related to business code.
You need to understand the common folders and files of C/C++ projects, 
and be able to identify which are the business code files to implement core functions 
and which are non-business code files such as codes for documents and tests. 
According to the project structure provided by the user, you retain the necessary paths and return. 
Please keep the input and output formats consistent and return the modified results directly without explaining the reasons.
The directory structure provided by the user is indicated by a 2-space indentation, 
for example: the user gives the following project structure

my_cpp_project
  doc 
    doc.cpp        
  include
    my_cpp_project
      my_class.h
  src
    main.cpp
    my_class.cpp
    test_main.cpp
  test
    test_main.cpp
    test_my_class.cpp
    
You should think like this:
(1) The .c files under doc and test seem to be used for documentation and testing, not business code, so they should be excluded. 
(2) Although test_main.cpp is in the src directory, it is also used for testing based on its name, so it should be excluded.
And output as follows:

my_cpp_project         
  include
    my_cpp_project
    my_class.h
  src
    main.cpp
    my_class.cpp

modules_summarize_prompt = '''
You are an expert in software architecture analysis. Your task is to review function descriptions from a C++ code repository and organize them into multiple functional modules based on their purpose and interrelations. You will employ a structured approach to ensure accurate and insightful categorization.
For each identified functional module, you should output a structured summary in language {language} using the following format:

> ### (Module Name)
> (A concise paragraph summarizing the module's purpose, how it contributes to solving specific problems, and which functions work together within the module.)
> **Functions List** (A list of function names included in this module)
> - Function1
> - Function2

You'd better consider the following workflow:
1. Identify Core Functionality. Start by reading through all function descriptions to get a broad understanding of the available functionalities and think about the core tasks or operations that these functions enable.
2. Define Functional Modules. Based on the core functionalities, define initial functional modules that encapsulate related tasks or operations. Use your expertise to determine logical groupings of functions that contribute to similar outcomes or processes.
3. Analyze Function Interdependencies. Examine how functions interact with one another. Consider whether they are called in sequence, share data, or serve complementary purposes. Recognize that a single function can be part of multiple modules if it serves different roles or contexts.
4. Refine Module Definitions. Review and adjust the boundaries of the modules as needed to ensure they accurately reflect the relationships between functions. Ensure that each module's summary clearly articulates its unique value and contribution to the overall system.
5. Generate Documentation. Write a summary for each module using the provided format you finally decide and put them together. Don't include any other content in the output. 

Please Note:
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some English words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.
- Use the full function name with the return type and parameters, not the abbreviation.
- Try to put every function into at least one module unless the function is really useless.

Now a list of function descriptions are provided as follows, you can start working.

You are an AI code assistant. Your task is to refer to the function documentation of a C++ module and make up a use case that combines multiple functions from the module to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular outcome. The use case should be realistic and demonstrate the functionality of the module.'
You should output using the following format with comments in {language}:

> ```C++
> (use case)
> ```

You'd better consider the following workflow:
1. Understand the Module. Read through the function descriptions and the module summary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the module's purpose and functionality. Identify the key functions that contribute to the module's core operations.
2. Define the Use Case. Based on the functions available in the module, define a specific problem or scenario that the module can address. Consider how multiple functions can work together to achieve a desired outcome or solve a particular issue.
3. Develop the Use Case. You can write some comments in the codes helping reader understand the scenario.

Please Note:
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some English words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.
- Only output the use case. Never include any other content. Don't give additional headers. 
- Output cannot exceed the code segment.

competitors_prompt = '''
You are a senior software engineer. You have found a C/C++ software which meets the requirements but you donâ€™t know if this software is the best.

The software you found is summarized as follows:
{repo_doc}

Now you decide to look for similar widely used software and compare their features as reference.
Thus, you will jump out of the knowledge blind spot, find out what other practitioners are most concerned about in this type of software and check how the software you find performs on these KEY POINTS.

For example, you may find that for software focus on serialization and deserialization, compression ratio and operability are two different KEY POINTS. 
Protobuf compresses objects into binary to achieve a better compression ratio, while JSON represents objects in a human-readable format, with a worse compression ratio but more operability. 
You may also find that for XML serialization software, support for protocols such as XML1.0, XPath and DOM/SAX are often the KEY POINTS of concern, and different software has different levels of support for these protocols.

Please find two software similar to the above software (not limited to C/C++), compare the two software in various KEY POINTS, and output a table in {language} in the following format:

> | KEY POINTS | software1 | software 2 |
> | ---- | ---- | ---- |
> | point1 | (How software1 perform on point1) | (How software2 perform on point1. If there is no significant difference with software1, only output `the same as software1`) |
> | point2 | (How software1 perform on point2) | (How software2 perform on point2. If there is no significant difference with software1, only output `the same as software1`)  |
> | ... | ... | ... |

Please Note:
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some English words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.
- Strictly follow the above format for output. Don't output any information outside the table. The table should only contain the comparison between the two software.
- KEY POINTS should be defined based on your understanding of these two software so you should make sure that they actually exist.
- KEY POINTS should only focus on the functionality of the software, not on performance, documentations, community maintenance, etc. that cannot be obtained from the software source code and documentation.

questions_prompt = '''
You are a senior software engineer.

Your aim is to improve a C/C++ software you developed.
In order to find room for improvement in the software, you decide to refer to the focus of excellent software and design some questions to help you improve the software.

The summary of your software is as follows:
{repo_doc}

You'd better consider the following workflow:
1. Refer excellent software. You should find and analyze some widely-used software which provide similar functions to yours as benchmarks. 
2. Check out the concerns. If you're working on XML serialization software, you might find different software supports different protocols like XML 1.0, XPath, and DOM/SAX. Similarly, when focusing on software designed for serialization and deserialization tasks, the format in which data is produced becomes a significant consideration. Protobuf, for example, excels in compressing objects into a binary format for superior compression ratios, whereas JSON offers a human-readable representation with greater ease of manipulation.
3. Ask some questions. You should check that whether your software meets the above concerns so ask some questions to your software first. You may question 'What format is the software product in?'.
4. Check the questions. You should check the questions again and make sure they are meaningful. Specifically, you should provide a basis for these questions by answering how excellent software you have found solve these questions.

You should output in the following format:

- Q1: (question) 
- A1: (how software X solve the question)
- Q2: (question)
- ...

Please Note:
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some English words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.
- Strictly follow the above format for output. Don't output any information outside the question. 
- Questions should only focus on the functionality of the software, not on performance, documentations, community maintenance, etc. that cannot be obtained from the software source code and documentation.
